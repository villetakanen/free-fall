# FREE//FALL 2048

<span class="text-caption">_Public Playtest release 0.7.x_</span>

## 1. THE PITCH

_The climate changed, the Mediterranean died, and Europe walled itself off._

_It is 2048. Humanity is caught between the suffocating heat of the Gravity Well and the freezing vacuum of the Void._

_You are a deniable asset. A mercenary operator working the shadows of a fractured solar system. From the vertical slums of the dam-city *Al Presa* to the rusting orbital platforms of the Belt, you take the jobs too dirty, too dangerous, and too illegal for corporate militaries._

_You are not defined by a character level or a hero's journey. You are defined by your Gear, your Augmentations, and your willingness to bleed._

_In FREE//FALL, capability is bought, spliced, or installed. But power is never free. Every piece of chrome, every high-grade weapon, and every jagged line of code you carry extracts a toll on your body and mind._

**The question isn't just *can* you survive the job. <br>It's what will be left of *you* when the job is done.**

## 2. THE WORLD
<span class="text-caption">A BRUTAL DUALITY</span>

### The Gravity Well

*Heat, humidity, biological decay, repurposed trash (Bricolage), scarcity, and the desperate hustle of millions trying not to fall.*

Earth is a testament to survival amidst collapse. The Mediterranean is a stagnant, algae-choked graveyard trapped behind the massive Gibraltar Dam. Fortress Europe guards its borders with automated lethal indifference. Third Orleans is the last free city of the Corporate States of America. China, Brazil, and all the great powers cling to what they can salvage.

### The Void

*Cold, vacuum, radiation, hard recycled air, blinding neon, corporate sterility vs. industrial rust, and the terrifying silence of the black.*

Break orbit, and the struggle shifts. Space is the domain of the Megacorps and the Block Nations. Orbital stations rotate under corporate flags, housing sterilized labs and overworked indentured contractors. 

## 3. HOW TO PLAY
<span class="text-caption">THE CORE SYSTEMS</span>

FREE//FALL v7 is a cinematic, highly tactical RPG built on resource management, simultaneous action, and brutal consequences.

### The Golden Rules

To survive the sprawl, remember the three principles of play:

1. **Optionality:** The rules are in place to support you. *Say yes, or...* roll the dice.
2. **Equality:** If a roll results in a draw, the players decide the order of resolution. The GM only arbitrates if the crew is divided.
3. **Specificity:** Specific rules (gear, augmentations, scenario effects) always beat general rules.

### The Action Pool: Split Focus

When chaos erupts, you roll an **Action Pool of 2 to 5 twenty-sided dice (d20)**.

- **Divide and Conquer:** You can split these dice across multiple goals or vectors. Need to sprint to cover (2 dice) while simultaneously hacking a corporate drone (3 dice)? You can try.
- **Simultaneous Resolution:** Actions are declared in order (NPCs, then Characters, then Bosses). Once declared, *everything happens at once*. In contested actions, the highest individual die rolled happens first.
- **Target Numbers:** You are looking for dice that equal or beat the GM's Target Number (TN). A Normal task requires no roll. Challenging is **11+**, Hard is **16+**, and Near Impossible is **21+**. A natural 20 is always a success.

### Power Has a Cost: Attributes & Skills

Your core Attributes measure your physical and mental bandwidth. You spend them on:

- **Bind Gear:** Powerful armor or cybernetics must be *Bound*. Wearing heavy plating might bind your physical attributes; running military-grade ice-breakers might bind your mental capacity. This locks down your maximum capacity.
- **Push the Limits:** Don't have the required Skill to hotwire a rover? You can still try, but it will cost you a point of a relevant Attribute—or require you to take immediate Harm to brute-force it.

### Survival: The Sacrifice

You have **3 Harm Slots**. Every time a slot is filled, you lose one die from your Action Pool. The more hurt you are, the less capable you become.

When you take a hit—whether it’s a bullet, a neural spike, or blackmail—you don't just lose HP. You face a choice on how to resolve the incoming damage:

1. **Take the Hit (Transient Harm):** Fill an empty Harm slot. You lose a die, but the injury is temporary and can be recovered during downtime.
2. **Bear the Scar (Permanent Harm):** Replace an existing Transient Harm with a Permanent one. You take a lasting narrative consequence to keep a slot open and stay in the fight.
3. **Break the Gear:** Mark a bound asset as *Broken*. Let the armor shatter so your ribs don't have to. Let the cyber-eye burn out to save your brain.

*If you suffer Harm and cannot make one of these three sacrifices, you are ousted from the game.*

## 4. THE THREAT
<span class="text-caption">THESEUS</span>

Looming behind the corporate wars is the THESEUS Foundation. Born from the ashes of the Copenhagen Incident (2037)—a catastrophic failure of AI containment—Theseus is the terrifying, bureaucratic shield against the "Post-Human Threat."

They are the boogeymen. They are the cleaners. And sometimes, if you're unlucky, they are your employers.

## 5. MISSION BRIEF
<span class="text-caption">CODENAME: NORTHERN LIGHTS.</span>

```
Incoming Encrypted Transmission...

SOURCE: $$REDACTED$$ // PROTOCOL: BLACK TARGET: 
Transport Vessel Njord's Whisper, drifting near 
the Jovian Trojan belts.

OBJECTIVE: Board the vessel.
- Extract hard-line data logs regarding the 
  "QNA" (Quantum Neural Array).
- Purge the QNA unit. Total neutralization.

ADVISORY:** Vessel appears dark. Thermal 
signatures suggest automated defenses are active. 
Crew considered compromised by Class-3 
contaminants (AI/Logic Virus).

RoE: No witnesses. The Copenhagen Protocol is 
in effect. If it thinks, kill it. If it moves,
break it.
