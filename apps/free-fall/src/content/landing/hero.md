# Year 2048

The climate changed, the Mediterranean died, and Europe walled itself off. 

It is 2048. Humanity is caught between the suffocating heat of the Gravity Well and the freezing vacuum of the Void.

You are a deniable asset. You are a mercenary operator working the shadows of a fractured solar system. From the vertical slums of the dam-city Al Presa to the rusting orbital platforms of the Belt, you take the jobs too dirty, too dangerous, or too illegal for corporate militaries.

You are not defined by a character level or a hero's journey. You are defined by your Gear, your Augmentations, and your willingness to bleed.

In FREE/FALL, capability is bought, spliced, or installed. But power is never free. Every piece of chrome, every high-grade weapon, and every jagged line of code you carry extracts a toll on your body and mind. 

The question isn't just can you survive the job. It's what will be left of you when the job is done.
