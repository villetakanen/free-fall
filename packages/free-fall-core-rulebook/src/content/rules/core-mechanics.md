# v7 Core / SRD

<span class="text-caption"> A System Reference Document for FREE//FALL v7 </span>

## Introduction

FREE//FALL v7 is a fast and tactical RPG system based on the exiting action resolution mechanics of Jukka Sorsa's [Hood](https://myrrys.com/hood/). This system reference defines core concepts, rules, techniques and mechanism in a game-agnostic manner.

## Action resolution

Every roll begins with a base pool of five twenty-sided dice (5d20). These are divided between one or more axes, allowing the character to spread their focus to multiple aspects of the situation at once. 

For each goal or action, the dice reserved for the action are rolled against a *Target Number (TN)* set by the *GM*. Any of the dice meeting or exceeding the TN are considered successes. By default 1 success is required for an action to resolve _as planned_.

As with most **d20** based games: result of 20 is considered always a success, regardless of the challenge rating or any other modifiers to the situation.

| Challenge           | Target Number |
| ------------------- | :-----------: |
| **Challenging**     | TN 11+        |
| **Hard**            | TN 16+        |
| **Near Impossible** | TN 21+        |

Depending on a game, the aspects dice are spit to might be called axes, vectors etc.

## Attributes

Characters posses a set resources called Attributes. An attribute has two ratings: initial and current. Attribute points can be used to:
1. Attempting an Action the characted does not have a **Skill** for
2. Reducing a level of incoming **Harm**
3. Binding gear etc. the character can utilize
4. Restoring points in another Attribute (by default 2 attribute points buy 1 of another attribute).

## Skills

A skill enables a character to attempt an action governed by the skill.

To act, without a skill granting the action, character has 2 options
1. Spend a point of Attribute
2. Take a Harm

## Harm & Consequences

Characters have 3 Harm slots. When a character suffers Harm, the player has 3 choices, for each level harm taken:
1. Fill in a free slot, with a **Temporary Harm**
2. Make a **Temporary Harm** permanent, possibly reframing it
3. Mark a bound item, gear etc. broken.

If a character takes one or more levels of Harm and is not able to any of the above: the character is _ousted_.

All temporary harm is removed with _downtime_ (think short rest).

Any broken gear or items can be fixed with time and actions, given the required skill and so foth.
